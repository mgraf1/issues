# Issues

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.4.

## Prereqs

The angular-cli must be installed to run the application. It can be installed with
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
Once it's installed, be sure to run
```
cd issues
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Depending on the version on nodejs installed, you may need to install @angular-devkit/core. It can be done with
```
npm install @angular-devkit/core
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
